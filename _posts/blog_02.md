# Type Study

### Project Outline

I'm in week three of my coding boot camp experience, and I'm currently working on an assignment to redesign the website of a local restaurant. *NOTE: This is purely a learning exercise, just for fun.* I've chosen Easy Tiger, a bake shop / beer garden on 6th Street. It's one of my favorite places in Austin, so it gives me a good excuse to spend a little more time there. You know, for research. It should be a fun project, and I'm pretty excited to share some of my process as I walk through it.

### Research

I started by taking a page out of Jason Santa Maria's book, *On Web Typography*, and used a word list. Luckily I had already created one as part of the assignment. Some of the words that stood out to me were *traditional*, *vintage*, *heritage*, and *hand-crafted*. At Easy Tiger all of their baked goods and the majority of their provisions are made by hand, in-house. They make things the old way, the traditional way. Even their space has a sort of weathered and worn appeal, as if it has been there for ages (it hasn't). So it only makes sense for any visuals representing the restaurant to have a sort of rustic, distressed (but not grungy) feel.

### Branding

One of the great things about the place is they have a really great design aesthetic. Their branding has a very handcrafted / heritage vibe, which really works for them, because that's the way they do business. So basically, Easy Tiger already has an existing aesthetic. That's a good thing. I'm glad to not be starting from scratch. I've heard it said before that, contrary to popular belief, constraints do not stifle creativity, they promote it. So I tried to choose typefaces that didn't stray from the established branding.

One major constraint for the project is that I'll be using Google fonts, so I can't use the same typefaces used in the restaurant. Their signage is comprised of custom hand-lettering and a round, geometric typeface in their store signage. I strayed from this a little in that I tried to choose humanist sans serif typefaces as opposed to geometric. Geometric typefaces are symmetrical, so they tend to be aesthetically pleasing, but are better suited for architectural or scientific purposes. Humanist typefaces are based on handwriting, and are generally a little easier to read. Easy Tiger has a very down-to-earth feel, so a humanist typeface is a bit more appropriate, as it is less cold and sterile looking, while not going off-brand. I chose several options, of varying widths and weights, to use for headings.

For body copy I chose several serif typefaces that shared similar traits or, sometimes, type designers. This was the furthest departure from the restaurant's existing styles, as they do not use serif typefaces at all.
