### Project Outline

I'm in week three of my coding boot camp experience, and I'm currently working on an assignment to redesign the website of a local restaurant. *NOTE: This is purely a learning exercise, just for fun.* I've chosen Easy Tiger, a bake shop / beer garden on 6th Street. It's one of my favorite places in Austin, so it gives me a good excuse to spend a little more time there. You know, for research. It should be a fun project, and I'm pretty excited to share some of my process as I walk through it.

### Branding

One of the great things about the place is they have a really great design aesthetic. Their branding has a very handcrafted / heritage vibe, which really works for them, because that's the way they do business.
