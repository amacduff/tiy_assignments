# CSS Zen Garden

## Project Details
This past weekend I had an assignment, for my course at The Iron Yard, to create a CSS Zen Garden. If you've never heard of it, The CSS Zen Garden is a challenge put forth by Dave Shea to create a unique website design using purely CSS. Everyone who participates in the challenge uses the same HTML file, which is not to be edited. The goal of the project is to show what can be done using only CSS.

The CSS Zen Garden has been around for more than a decade, and has become a rite of passage for web designers. Anyone can submit a design, and those that are deemed worthy get the honor of being featured in the CSS Zen Garden archives alongside hosts of notable designers, and of course all the fame and recognition that entails (mainly high fives at dribbble meetups). All that to say, in the world of web design, the CSS Zen Garden is kind of a big deal.

## Project Requirements
We were given three days to create a stylesheet, and each student was assigned an art movement to use as a basis for their work. Additionally, we were given a few basic requirements. Our design was to include:
- One :before element
- One :after element
- One animation
- Minimum 2 breakpoints

## My Approach
Some of the most popular CSS Zen Garden designs have been created by people I look up to, so this assignment was especially challenging for me. Browsing through the archives, it was hard to imagine I could ever create anything as glorious as what I saw. But I tried to remind myself that from its inception, this was meant to be a learning exercise. Plus it was an assignment for school, so I needed to get on with it.

I was assigned op art as the theme for my work. I had never even heard of it! After some quick googling I learned that op art is mainly optical illusions based on Gestalt theory. Pretty cool, but I had no idea how to translate this into a cohesive design for the web. So I decided to do some more research. I read up on op art and its artists' goals, looked at a lot of imagery that made my eyes cross and my vision blur. In the end, I decided that the core of op art is tricking the eye into seeing something that's not there, be it movement, an extra dimension, etc. This gave me a better idea for how to tackle this beast.
