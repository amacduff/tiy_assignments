# Final Project Idea

## The Problem
What to make for dinner. It's a real problem. I don't want to eat out all the time, I want to make meals at home. And when I cook, I use recipes, because I'm not someone who knows what ingredients would go well together. So I use cook books or look up recipes on the internet. The challenging part is that there's always at least one ingredient in the recipe that I don't have, and I don't want to have to run to the store every night to get those couple ingredients I need to make dinner. So I waste a lot of time looking at various recipes that I can't use because I don't have all the ingredients, and then I usually end up making something with the least number of ingredients I don't have.

## The Solution
The solution for this problem is pretty simple: a web app where I can enter the ingredients I have to work with, and get recipes based on those ingredients. No extra trips to the store necessary.

## The Why
I believe everyone should be able to make delicious, healthy meals at home using ingredients they already have.

## The How
Using the magic of the internet to serve up great recipes based on ingredients used.

## The What
An awesome web app that everyone will want to use (especially me)!
