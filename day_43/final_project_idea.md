# Final Project Idea

## The Problem
I'm an introvert and have a hard time approaching design/tech people I look up to.

## The Solution
A web app where people could enter to win coffee/lunch with a design/tech person.

## The Why
Because our social construct favors extroverts. I believe introverts should have opportunities to meet people they admire.

## The How
I want to level the playing field by choosing randomly who gets to meet with a design/tech person.

## The What
An awesome web app that everyone will want to use (especially me)!
