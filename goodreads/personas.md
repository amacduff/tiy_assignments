# GoodReads Personas

## Matilda, 23
She's out of college, so she's starting to read for fun again. She has an entry level marketing job. She wants to see what her friends are reading and what's popular in her favorite genres, and she has a goal of reading 30 books this year. She likes to read young adult fiction and in her free time she rides a unicycle.


## Jennifer, 36
She has two kids and homeschools. She doesn't have much time to read, so she likes to use the site for recommendations and reviews (mostly from friends) and making lists. She likes historical fiction and has a Civil War crush.

## David, 42
Single and middle aged, he works at a non-profit organization. He travels a lot for work, so he reads on the plane and in airports. He goes through books fairly quickly. He uses the site to keep track of what he's read, and to get recommendations for what he should read next. He enjoys reading nonfiction and biographies, and likes to play golf.
