## Brief Overview

Op Art is a mainly abstract style of art. It uses a lot of black and white, and contrasting colors. The majority of Op Art utilizes Gestalt Principles, or optical illusions, to create a sense of movement.


## History

Op Art has elements of several other art movements, including Neo-Impressionism, Cubism, Futurism, Constructivism, and Dada. It is mainly derived from the constructivist practices of the Bauhaus, a German design school that stressed form and function. It is experimental in nature, using mathematically based compositions to create works of art that appear to move, or be three dimensional.


## Techniques

### Black & White
- Discordant figure/ground relationship, using varying black and white lines next to each other to suggest shapes
- After-image, or the sense of seeing a certain color after looking at an image, based on how the retina receives and processes light

### Color
- Simultaneous contrast, surrounding one color with a contrasting color
- Successive contrast, viewing one color and then another
- Reverse contrast, an effect of color spreading to neighboring areas of color


## Summary

Op Art uses abstract minimalism, black and white, and contrasting colors to evoke a sense of movement or life.
